🧠 Modular Agentic AI Chatbots
This project showcases three modular AI chatbot systems built using LangChain, LangGraph, Streamlit, and Groq-provided LLMs. Each module demonstrates increasing levels of agentic reasoning and external tool integration.

📦 Project Modules
1. Basic Chatbot
A foundational chatbot powered by Groq-hosted language models. It handles natural language conversation end-to-end with no external logic.

    ✅ Ultra-fast responses with Groq
    
    🧠 Core LLM dialog
    
    🛠 No tools or APIs

2. Chatbot with Tools
An enhanced chatbot that uses LangGraph to dynamically call external tools (e.g., calculator, weather, or search) when needed.

    🧠 Groq LLM + Tools
    
    🔄 Decision-based tool usage
    
    ⚙️ Agent orchestration via LangGraph

3. AI News Summarizer (AI in Aviation)
An advanced agent that fetches the latest AI in aviation-related news, summarizes it using a Groq-powered LLM, and stores the result.

    🌐 Live news fetching via API
    
    ✈️ Focus: AI trends in aviation
